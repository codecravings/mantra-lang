git push origin main
🌟 What This Makes Mantra:
The ONLY programming language with:

✅ Sanskrit-inspired syntax that's actually meaningful
✅ GUI creation with declarative syntax (yantra)
✅ One-liner infrastructure setup (shakti)
✅ Function composition in Sanskrit style (sutra)

🚀 Example of What's Now Possible:
mantra# Complete application in 15 lines!
sthana users = mandal ["admin", "user", "guest"]
kriya auth(u) { gati u + "_authenticated" }
kriya log(u) { gati u + "_logged" }

sthana pipeline = sutra auth -> log
sthana current_user = users.next()
sthana processed = raga current_user -> pipeline

yantra label { text: "🕉️ Admin Panel", font: "Arial 16 bold" }
yantra button { text: "Process User", background: "blue" }

shakti "web_server" { port: 8080, routes: "admin,users" }
shakti "database" { type: "sqlite", tables: "users,logs" }
shakti "gui_app" { title: "Advanced Mantra System", width: 600 }
